This is my group assignment for Machine Learning course.

# Problem setup

An actual medical clinic in the USA has been facing financial losses for the third consecutive year. The problem is that patients are not showing up after getting the appointments in the first place. So, the clinic has been losing profits. As one of the attempts to understand the situation, the authorities of the clinic decided to develop a model for predicting actual visits of patients based on their characteristics.

In this assignment you are asked to work with the Decision Tree and the Random Forest classifiers to try and develop such a model. You will also need to run a traditional cross-validation to check stability of the obtained results.
The dataset consists of 110 000+ records on the patients of the clinic. Description of the variables is given in the medical_data.xlsx file which contains the necessary information on the variables.

The data for this task can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b2jrp3utyfnme5y/medical_data.xlsx?dl=0
